# IrrlichtBAW

Build A World fork of Irrlicht, currently aiming for a threadable and Vulkan-centered API.

We forked after realizing we have too many patches which entail big API changes to ever be merged into stock Irrlicht.

For those not faint of heart, you can find out more about what this is and how it differs from stock Irrlicht by reading this thread:
http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=49672

Excuse us for not providing a proper readme, I (devsh) am really busy with my day-business of Build A World EDU.
